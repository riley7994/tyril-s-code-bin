<h1>i need to organize my thoughts</h1>
<p> the importance of organizing your thoughts is highly important. if we didn's organize our thoughts, we'd be very unfortunate in conducting our affairs. unfortunate indeed. playing the game of chess can greatly improve prediction, ligical reasoning, and imaginitive skills depending on how you enjoy experiencing the game at hand. some players may enjoy the raw, cold deuctive and predictive logical aspect of the game, whilst others such as myself enjoy deducting the metophorical and abstract implications of certian chess games</p>

<h2> random thoughts</h2>
<p> i suppose what im doing right now could be considered constructing the shell of a webpage. it may not be fancy quite yet seeing as though no graphics have been added through css, but what really matters on a webpage is the content at the end of the day, but i say this not to discredit the value of css, but to emphasise the importance of having revelant, helpful, informative, in demand content in your webpages. (although css will be added soon) </p>


<h1> creating webpages</h1>
<p>The act of creating webpages is actually quite fun. the implications of what you can do with this sort of coding language is virtually endless as far as conveying informative and relevant information is concerned. although you could waste time creating pointless webpages, but is there truly anything such as a pointless webpage? information is just that, information at the end of the day</p>
